In this app, we play the Madlibs game, where a user is given a list of type of words. 
The user has to then fill in their own choice of words, which are then put in a story.
It is funny to read how the resulting story does not turn out to be cohesive at all. 
Of course, the user can play again, getting a different story since the given stories a randomly chosen for a surprise element. 
Screenshots of the app can be seen below:
